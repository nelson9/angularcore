                                We are a small, but take pride in how we teach.

                                We enjoy teaching languages and love to see how our students learn and progress.

                            <li>
                                We tailor our lessons for every single student or group to suit their needs, adapting throughout the course whenever is needed - that is the key to our success.

                                We understand that learning a language is not easy and takes practice. We provide our students with the tools to carry on practicing the different skills (oral, listening, grammar, reading) outside the classroom with podcasts, apps, books and plenty of other materials.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We continually provide feedback to students so they know their level and how they are progressing.

                    <p>
                        All our teachers are qualified and experienced Spanish or Latin American natives who have an excellent understanding of the Spanish and English languages.
                        We are approachable, we offer relaxed but professional lessons and believe they need to be enjoyable and fun in order to succeed. We understand the importance of cultural references to fully understand a new language and take it into account during the lessons.
                        We use our own materials and the best resources compiled throughout the years with many interactive and self-testing computer based resources and apps you can use when commuting.
